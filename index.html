Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud. Word clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites.</p><p>Data Set:</p><p>Name: Wine Reviews</p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews">Kaggle</a></p><p>Note: We could not load this dataset and plot the graphs from our jupyter notebook here again, however since the dataset is too huge in size for Idyll, it runs out of memory while reading the data so we have resorted to another medium. These same graphs and visualizations are built and designed in our jupyter notebook and we have included them here as images.</p></div><div style="background-color:#E4D4C8;padding:50px" idyll="[object Object]"><div class=" idyll-text-container"><h1 id="data-set-description">Data Set Description</h1><p>The Wine Review data set consists of 129970 rows of reviews of Wine and 13 columns out of which 2 are numeric: Points and Price and rest are characteristic values such as Country of Origin, description of the Wine, Winery, Variety, Taster Name, etc. These observations are nothing but reviews of Wines from all over the world, tasted and reviewed by multiple renoun tasters. These tasters travel around the world reviewing Wines as a profession and rating them. These reviews are used to rate the most Exclusive Wines across the world.</p><p>This data set is taken from the Wine Enthusiast Website. The columns are described as mentioned below:</p><ul><li>Country of Origin is the country where wine was originally produced.</li><li>Description contains actual reviews about the wine.</li><li>Points describes quality of the wine. This score is out of <!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->0 <!-- -->indicating higher the value better is the quality.</li><li>Price is in USD for easy comparison of wines all over the world.</li><li>Province has states of country that wine originates from.</li><li>taster name and twitter handle as the name suggests contains name of famous coneissours of Wine and their Twitter account handles.</li><li>Title is the name of wine as sold in shops.</li><li>Variety is the general category wine is part of.</li><li>Winery column contains the name of winery that produces wine.</li></ul><p>
We will be exploring this data set with a major focus on descriptions of reviews, country of origin, tasters and variety of wines.
To start with, lets look at a Word Cloud of the Descriptions to understand the overall reviews:</p><img src="static/images/des_wc.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div></div><div style="background-color:#C7A19B;padding:50px" idyll="[object Object]"><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-0" style="position:relative"><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><img src="static/images/0.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><img src="static/images/1.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><img src="static/images/2.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="top-15-wine-varieties-for-the-top-3-countries">Top <!-- -->1<!-- -->5 <!-- -->Wine Varieties for the Top <!-- -->3 <!-- -->Countries</h2></div><div class="idyll-step "><h3 id="united-states">United States</h3><img src="static/images/4.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><h3 id="france">France</h3><img src="static/images/5.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><h3 id="italy">Italy</h3><img src="static/images/6.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><div class="idyll-step "><h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
